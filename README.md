## User stories
1) As a cafe administrator, want to minimize number of waiter, while makeing my clients feel comfortable in the cafe. So they don't have to wait for the menu. In addition, the food was delivered instantly, if the client needs a waiter for some purpose, the waiter will be available at that moment. As a result, find out the opinion and assessment of the client about the cafe and the dish
2) As an employer a waiter. I don't want to go and give menus to every customer who comes. Also, wait for them to choose a meal from the menu, or come back to ask what they have chosen. Also, it's tricky while you're serving one customer, other customers are asking for their service, which complicates me and leads to forgetting customer requests
3) As a customer, I want to have a lunch immediately and don't want to wait for a menu long. Also when waiter come with menu I would like to know in how much minute will be ready as I am hungry and can not wait for long. In addition I would like to know what is consist of food as I don't eat food with sugar and pig .
4) As a client who is introvert, I would like to not talk with waiter instead call him when I need it. Sometimes I sit and work at cafe and want to order something later , so it will make me uncomfortable and break my concentration when someone comes and asks me what WILL I order.

## Non-Functional requirements

The application will be used 100 active users.
The application must be hosted in web server.
The application must work in all modern browsers

## Risks
At lunch and evening might have problems on server as all the client's come to cafe, it can be solved if our application will be popular, we will have investors and will buy server for more clients. Someone wants to do fishing by changing qr code, so Client thinks that have to pay after choosing menu. It can be prevented by note on table. 
Business: Initially might have problems with QR, As client's  don't know why it's needed. Even they can wait for long for a waiter as they wait for system. There might be problem with elderly people as they don't know how to use mobile phone properly and are not able to make any order.
